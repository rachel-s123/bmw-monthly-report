# Dynamic Visualization System

## Overview

The BMW Monthly Report Dashboard now features a **dynamic visualization system** that automatically adapts charts and visualizations based on the selected filters (market and month). This system ensures users see the most relevant and insightful visualizations for their current data view.

## How It Works

### 1. Visualization Context Detection

The system automatically detects the visualization context based on filter combinations:

- **Single Market, Single Month**: Detailed analysis for specific market and month
- **All Markets, Single Month**: Market comparison for the selected month
- **Single Market, All Months**: Performance trends over time for the selected market
- **All Markets, All Months**: Complete overview across all markets and time periods

### 2. Dynamic Chart Selection

Based on the detected context, the system automatically shows the most relevant charts:

#### Context 1: Single Market, Single Month
- Channel Distribution Chart
- Conversion Funnel Chart
- Month-over-Month Comparison
- KPI Summary Cards

#### Context 2: All Markets, Single Month
- Market Performance Comparison
- Channel Distribution Chart
- Conversion Funnel Chart

#### Context 3: Single Market, All Months
- KPI Trends Over Time (Line Chart)

- Performance Summary

#### Context 4: All Markets, All Months

### 3. Smart Data Preparation

Each chart type has specialized data preparation functions:

- **Channel Distribution**: Aggregates data by channel type with spend and NVWR metrics
- **Funnel Chart**: Creates conversion funnel from impressions â†’ clicks â†’ leads â†’ NVWR
- **KPI Trends**: Prepares time-series data for trend analysis
